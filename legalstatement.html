                        <h2>Legal Issues and Processes</h2>
                        <h5>Introduction</h5>
                        <p>In this digital era, one relies on sophisticated software technology in almost every aspect of our daily lives. This fact is an ode to the power technology possesses to change people’s lives within the span of a few years. As the cutting edge of technology has progressed, there are now tools at our disposal that can help restore smooth communication at the level of equals for those who may not otherwise be able to. Thus, we have aimed to make use of these revolutionary tools available to us to aid those suffering from Motor Neurone Disease, or anyone who may have trouble using their own voice, by creating a text-to-speech (TTS) tool that emulates real human interactions by adding emotional variations to the speech produced. This document aims to outline the legal licence underpinning our project, focusing on delivering an enriching emotional TTS experience. </p>
                        <h5>Potential Liabilities</h5>
                        <p>In developing our emotional text-to-speech (TTS) project, we acknowledge several key liabilities that our team must navigate:</p>
                        <p>Firstly, and of paramount importance, is our commitment to creating an emotional TTS application that not only meets but exceeds the expectations set forth at the project's inception. Our goal is to develop a tool that transforms text into emotionally nuanced speech, utilising state-of-the-art technology to ensure a high-quality user experience. The project timeline is meticulously planned to ensure delivery by the stipulated deadline, with strategic milestones in place to monitor our progress. As long as we adhere to our detailed project plan, we anticipate meeting our deadline without compromising on the quality or performance of the application.
                        </p>
                        <p>Given the nature of our software, which involves sophisticated algorithms and software components from a variety of sources, it is crucial that we respect all intellectual property rights and licences. This includes not distributing or making public any proprietary libraries or code without explicit consent from the rights holders. Our adherence to these guidelines is critical to maintain trust and legality in our development process and we have endeavoured to do so by making use of strictly open source technology only.
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the issue of project visibility and distribution is a significant consideration. While our development efforts are collaborative and transparent within our team, we must respect the wishes of any stakeholders regarding the publicity of the project work. This encompasses the visibility of our code repositories, the sharing of our development process, and any potential publication of the project outcomes. We are committed to honouring these preferences, ensuring that our project complies with all contractual and ethical obligations.
                        </p>


                        <h5>Intellectual Property and Licences</h5>
                        <p>
                            In the development of our project, we proudly embrace the ethos of open-source software. Our project leverages a rich ecosystem of open-source technologies. These include Streamlit[1], a frontend development Python library, as well as Vall-E-X[2], a TTS model by Microsoft available under the most permissive MIT licence[3], and DistilRoBERTa, a similarly permissive text analysis language model under the Apache 2.0 licence. These tools represent the pinnacle of open source technology being made accessible to all who may wish to use or develop these applications further. Our commitment to open-source principles extends to our own development processes, with our project being fully open-source and available for community use, modification, and improvement.
                            </p>
                            <p>We recognize the importance of honouring the licensing agreements of the open-source technologies we utilise. Each of these technologies is distributed under licences that encourage free use, modification, and distribution, aligning with our vision of fostering innovation and collaboration within the open-source community. 
                            </p>
                            <p>In accordance with open-source best practices, our project includes clear attributions for all third-party open-source technologies we incorporate. We understand the value of recognizing the contributions of others and strive to ensure that all use of external open-source software within our project is properly attributed and in compliance with the respective licences.

                            </p>
                        <h5>Data Privacy Considerations</h5>
                        <p>
                            Our project, an advanced emotional text-to-speech (TTS) technology, is designed with user privacy and data security as foundational principles. Recognizing the importance of personal privacy, our system is architecturally structured to operate independently of any need to collect, process, or store personal data from our users.
                            </p>
                        <p>The core functionality of our emotional TTS technology enables the conversion of text into speech audio[4] with emotional tonal variations completely offline, directly on the user's local device. This process is self-contained, ensuring that no data needs transmission for the software to fulfil its purpose and that all generated audio files are stored locally on the user's machine. No information is transmitted back to us or any third parties at any point in the system architecture. The integrity of the user's personal data remains untouched and unmonitored by our system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To facilitate the operation of our emotional TTS tool, we provide an installer that sets up the necessary model files on the user's local machine. This setup process is designed to be transparent and self-sufficient, requiring no exchange of personal data between the user and any non-local servers. A closed loop of data handling is maintained by the installer and the software itself where no external data capture occurs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By using our emotional TTS technology, users can be assured of a privacy-centric experience that respects their data sovereignty, providing a secure and enriching interaction with digital content through emotional engagement, free from the concerns of personal data misuse.
                                </p>
                        <h5>Sustainability Statement</h5>
                        <p>In the development of our emotional text-to-speech (TTS) application, sustainability and efficiency have been pivotal considerations guiding our engineering decisions and optimizations as one of our main goals was to make this technology as accessible as possible to users of every skill level. We have optimised the use of computational power required for the sentiment analysis component of our project. Microsoft VallE-X’s ability to generate audio using a CPU only also guided our decision to incorporate this open source model into our final software. This strategy of guiding each decision towards ultimate efficiency also involves the selective usage of our sentiment analysis model only when explicitly chosen by the user. Our TTS model is activated only during synthesis of audio, ensuring that the computational power is used judiciously, thereby minimising unnecessary energy consumption.

                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover, understanding the importance of minimising the environmental footprint of digital technologies, we've focused on developing a lightweight application. Our commitment to environmental sustainability is reflected in our choice of technologies and development practices. We have prioritised the use of efficient coding practices and have carefully selected libraries and frameworks known for their performance and low overhead such as streamlit.This reduces the processing power required for installing and running the application, which in turn lowers the energy consumption on the user's device. By refining these processes in a way that allows use of our software on hardware below the current standard requirements for such technology, our application not only offers a seamless and responsive user experience but also contributes to a reduction in the electronic waste generated by frequently upgrading hardware due to software demands.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our research into the most efficient programming techniques and our application's architecture, which prioritises the conservation of both computational and human resources, underlines our dedication to sustainability. Through these measures, our emotional TTS application stands as a testament to our commitment to creating technology that is both powerful and sustainable, ensuring a better future for both our users and the environment.

                        </p>
                        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                        <p>Through this legal considerations statement, we have investigated the potential liabilities, intellectual property and licences, privacy concerns as well as the sustainability aspects of our project through a critical lens, ensuring that our software meets the standards required in every facet. Although we have made the utmost effort to address any legal concerns that may arise and done our best to make the project as sustainable for resource usage as possible, we aim to continually improve the product and continue to address any potential legal concerns at every stage. 
                        </p>
